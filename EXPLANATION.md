# E-Commerce Platform Codebase Explanation

This codebase implements a scalable, multi-tier e-commerce platform using **C#**, **ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)**, and **Entity Framework Core**. The solution is organized into distinct projects for API controllers, business services, data access, shared models, and unit tests.

---

## Design Choices

- **Separation of Concerns**
  - Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses, delegating business logic to service classes.
  - Services encapsulate business rules, validation, and error handling, keeping controllers thin.
  - Repositories abstract data access, making it easy to swap or mock data sources for testing.

- **Dependency Injection**
  - All services and repositories are injected via constructors, promoting testability and loose coupling.

- **Error Handling & Logging**
  - Try-catch blocks and `ILogger` are used throughout services and controllers to log errors and provide robust error responses.

- **Input Validation**
  - Data annotations and explicit checks ensure only valid data is processed, improving reliability and security.

- **Session and Persistent Cart Support**
  - The cart functionality supports both session-based (for guests) and persistent (for authenticated users) storage.

- **Extensibility**
  - The design allows for easy addition of features (e.g., product recommendations, discounts, multi-currency) and integration with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways).

- **Containerization & Cloud Readiness**
  - Docker and Docker Compose files are provided for local and cloud deployment, with environment variable support for configuration.
  - AWS deployment instructions are included for Elastic Beanstalk and RDS.

## Method Choices

- CRUD operations are implemented with clear time and space complexity comments for maintainability.
- Business logic (e.g., stock validation, checkout) is handled in services, not controllers.
- Unit tests use mocks to isolate and verify service and controller behavior.

## Summary

The code is designed for clarity, maintainability, and scalability, following best practices for modern .NET web applications. Each layer is responsible for a specific concern, making the system robust and easy to extend or test.
